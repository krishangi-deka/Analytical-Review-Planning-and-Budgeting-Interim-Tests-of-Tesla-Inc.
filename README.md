# Analytical-Review-Planning-and-Budgeting-Interim-Tests-of-Tesla-Inc.

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Tesla INC (TSLA) as of and for the year ended 
December 31, 2020, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, we 
considered the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing our 
auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Our consideration of internal control was for the 
limited purpose described in the preceding paragraph and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal 
control that might be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses and therefore, there can be no assurance that all 
deficiencies, significant deficiencies, or material weaknesses have been identified. However, as discussed below, we 
identified certain deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses shipment and collection 
receipt. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management 
or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent,
or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s 
financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. We consider the following 
deficiencies in the Company’s internal control to be material weaknesses: 

(i) Our primary investigation showed that the major value accounts of the firm are non-normal distributions 
which pose a higher risk to the audit. This continuation of non-normal distributions will increase the risk 
of the audit as compared to prior years.
A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a 
material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. We consider the 
following deficiencies in the Company’s internal control to be significant deficiencies: shipment and collection receipt

(ii) Upon further investigation it was made clear that some employees have not been entirely honest with 
the expenditure policies of tesla because they have been submitting receipts of more than $490 and less 
than $500 with in a span of 30 days.

(iii) There were some other irregularities in Duplicates and omissions of Shipment orders and Invoice 
numbers which was higher than 1%. But since the value was less than 5% we consider it to be material 
errors and suggest management take steps to reduce it.
